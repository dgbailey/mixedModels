## Independence of errors

**What is this? Why is this important**

We are trying to predict or demonstrate a relationship between two observed quantities (dependent & independent).<br >

As one quantity changes (A) in two dimensions how can we model this relationship to (B) as a line ? Resulting in (A,B) coortinates in a Cartesian plane.

**What are these coordiantes (Observed values)**

Typically it is what you are interested in. For instance how does the size of an organization impact money spent in a SaaS product.<br>

But we are interested in predicting how each member added impacts dollars spent. So we use a line to assess incremental impact. A slope. A rise over run. <br> 

**Two dimensions**
The least squares regression line is a line that best fits the data points in a way that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances between the line and the points
